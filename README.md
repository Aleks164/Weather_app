## Weather_app

Creating a website with the ability to search for weather in any city and simultaneously view it in your city without any request. The site also displays an interactive list of 10 cities in which the weather was previously requested, which allows you to find out the weather in the city from the list by clicking on it with the mouse.

You also can go to the site by clicking here https://aleks164.github.io/Weather_app/
